# Changelog

## [0.1.6]

### Fixed
- Fixed InvalidFooter error in Arrow IPC stream by ensuring proper footer is written even when no data is returned
- Added empty record batch creation for queries with no results to maintain valid Arrow stream format
- Fixed schema ownership issues in empty batch creation

## [0.1.5]

### Fixed
- Fixed critical "a bytes-like object is required, not 'list'" error in query_arrow_ipc method by properly converting Vec<u8> to Python bytes

## [0.1.4]

### Fixed
- Fixed code formatting issues in Rust source code
- Removed trailing whitespace in lib.rs
- Fixed "a bytes-like object is required, not 'list'" error in query_polars and query_pandas functions
- Properly convert Vec<u8> to PyBytes for BytesIO compatibility
